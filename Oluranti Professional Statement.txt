I am Oluranti Oosko, an Architecture graduate who has loved Information Technology. My interest began with trying to troubleshoot little issues from using Microsoft technology.This interest made me develop the love for learning the basics of IT. I am presently the go-to-person for fixing system related issues physically and virtual.

I saw myself more into technology than Architecture which made me enrol for the Cybersecurity, which I see as I career I want to pursue. I am someone who understands the
value of details. I am good with system hardware troubleshooting, hardware installation and
software troubleshooting.

I'm pursuing cybersecurity to achieve a potential I saw in myself as well as following a loved passion.
